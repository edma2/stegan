stegan.py
Author: Eugene Ma (edma2)

Dependencies: 
----------------------
PyCrypto (https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/)
PIL (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)

Description:
----------------------
stegan.py has two modes of operation.

When encoding an image with data, the input will be compressed and encrypted
before each bit is encoded in the least significant bit of each pixel channel
in the image.

When decoding an image for data, the least significant bit of each channel of
each pixel is extracted, the resulting data is decrypted and decompressed.

Usage:
----------------------
if the input or output file is not given, assume standard input and standard
output, respectively.

How to encode a file: 
$ stegan.py enc <image> [-i input file] [-o output file]

How to decode an image: 
$ stegan.py dec <image> [-o output file]
